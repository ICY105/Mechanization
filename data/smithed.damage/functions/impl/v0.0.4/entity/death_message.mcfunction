# @doc entity/death_messages
# Death messages happen when a player is killed via the custom [damage](apply.md),
# you can add death messages by adding your function to the tag `#smithed.damage:event/player/on_death_message`
# 
# # Example Implementation
# `function: example:damage_player`
# ```mcfunction
# tag @s add my_attack                          # Add a tag so that we can tell that it was
#                                               # our damage that killed the player
# scoreboard players set @s smithed.damage 5
# function #smithed.damage:entity/apply/armor
# tag @s remove my_attack                       # Remove tag
# ```
# `function: example:death_message`
# ```mcfunction
# # Check to make sure the entity has our tag
# execute if entity @s[tag=my_attack] run tellraw @a [{"selector":"@s"}," got bloingo'ed"]
# ```
# `tag: #smithed.damage:event/player/on_death_message`
