# To alter the value of a setting, change the number at the end of the line. For example:
#   scoreboard players set #base.cf.tin_rarity mechanization.data 8
# Could be changed to:                                   V
#   scoreboard players set #base.cf.tin_rarity mechanization.data 24
# This would greatly increase how much tin ore generates per chunk
