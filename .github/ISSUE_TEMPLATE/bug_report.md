1. What datapack(s) do you have installed (including ones made by me- include version if possible).

2. Run /reload. Copy/paste or post a screenshot of what appears in chat (should say [Loaded <datapack> <version>]).

3. What environment are you running the datapack? (Vanilla single player, Vanilla multiplayer, Forge, fabric, spigot, bukkit, paper, optifine, realms, etc). Please specify exact Minecraft version as well.

4. What if happening vs. what you expect to happen?
